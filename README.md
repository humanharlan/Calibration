# Calibration

I made this text-based recreation of the CFAR Credence Calibration Game. 
To read more about the original game that I tried to recreate, visit http://acritch.com/credence-game/ 
To play an updated, web-based version of this game, visit http://acritch.com/credence-game/

Check out ExampleOutput.txt to see what a play-through looks like.

I did this project to practice developing in Java. If I develop this application further, I will try to implement it as an android application.
